# Global Consumption

## Overview
This dashboard explores patterns in global energy use, comparing fossil fuel reliance, renewable energy share, 
Carbon monoxide emissions, and energy prices across 10 countries over a period of 25 years.

### Key Metrics
- Countries: 10
- Report Years: 25
- Average Energy Consumption: 5,140 kWh


## Project Sections

### Dashboard Filters
- Year Selector: Allows filtering data by year range.
- Country Selector: Filters visualizations based on a specific country.

### Carbon Emissions vs Per Capita Consumption
    Question Explored; Is carbon emission tied to per capita energy use?
    
#### Insights:
    - Countries like Russia and China show higher Carbon dioxide emissions relative to energy use.
    - Australia and Canada have lower emissions per unit energy.
    - USA is centrally positioned, suggesting a balance in its emissions to energy use ratio.

### Fossil(%) vs Renewable Energy(%) Usage by Country
      Question Explored:
      Which Countries rely more on fossil fuel vs renewables?

#### Insights:
      - Germany leads in renewable adoption among the listed countries.
      - India and USA still show significant fossil fuel dependency.
      - A visible shift in energy strategy is evident in UK and Japan, with near parity between 
        fossil and renewabe shares.
      
### Energy Price Index(USD/kWh) vs Renewable Energy Share(%)
        Question Explored: Does renewable energy adoption lower energy prices?

#### Insights: 
       - While renewable energy appears stable, energy prices flunctuate across years.
       - 2016 and 2020 saw ower prices possibly aligned with increased renewable penetration.
       - However the relation is not strongly linear, indicating other market factors influence prices.

### Top 4 Carbon Emitting Countries (2020-2024)
        Question Explored: Which countries emitted the most Carbon dioxide?

#### Insights:
        - China Consistently emits the most Carbon dioxide each year.
        - USA and Russia follow, with Canada also appearing frequently.
        - Trends show flunctuating emissions, possibly due to policy changes, economic activity or renewable adoption.


### Summary of Findings
         -There is some correlation between energy use and carbon emissions, but efficiency and energy source mix matter 
          greatly.
         - Countries with higher renewable energy share do not always enjoy the lowest energy prices.
         - A Transition to renewable energy is visible in many developed nations, though fossil fuel use remains high.

### Tools Used
          - Excel for cleaning
          - Power BI for dashboard development
          - Languages/Tech: DAX
          - Data Source:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-energy-consumption-2000-2024
    
### Future Enhancements
          - Add interactive tooltips with more metadata.
          - Expand analysis to include developing countries.
          - Add forecasting models for energy trends (ARIMA,Prophet)
